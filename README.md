<h1>What I Did</h1><h4>Nathaniel Sherrett, Rust Programming, 1/28/2020</h4>
<p>For homework 2 we were assigned to create an RSA. This is officially my first form on encrpytion programming and was really interesting to me. 
The RSA uses a fixed exponent that was defined at the top of my file then we created a `genkey()` function that creates a private key which is then multiplied by
each other into a public key which is then used to encrypt your message. To decrypt you need the key generated by the `genkey()` function.  </p>
<h1>How it went</h1>
<p>At the start of most school projects I spent my first 2 hours putting it all together reading the psuedo code and eventually running into enough problems that I didn't know about.
I then decided to take the advice of the assignment sheet and go to the wiki and read up on how RSA works. This helped tremendously because I spent a long time trying to make a lambda function when there was no need. The last hickup was trying to test it with a main function... But I realized that we didn't make a `main.rs` so it wouldn't run a main. I then created a test file and all was good.  </p>
<h1>How I tested my work</h1>
<p>I followed the instructions of the assignment by this point and created a seperate directory and file for testing. I used the base test that was given to us and decided that was sufficient because there is no possible way that my code could break in any other case than that one.  </p>
